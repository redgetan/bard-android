[ ] android
  [x] migrate realm db from old schema to new schema
  [x] should list character/scenes
  [x] dont hit getQuery, go directly to cdn
  [ ] remove lag when selecting character/scene
  [ ] bardeditor should fetch wordlist (scenes/all)
  [ ] repo saved should be namespaced by username
  [ ] if i click multiple wordtag too fast, imageplaceholder wont work properly
  [ ] i click wordtag, crappy segment would show up, its not obvious i can switch it (left/right toggle not visible)
  [ ] default view is library
  [ ] implement logout
  [ ] add mixpanel (measure duration of generateBardVideo, what character, words they used)
  [ ] add instabug feedback form in about page
  [ ] add tell friends/follow/privacy/logout rows in about page
  [ ] initializing wordlist is too slow (find out why, and improve)
